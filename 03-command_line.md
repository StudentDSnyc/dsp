# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

What does `ls` do? What do `ls -a`, `ls -l`, and `ls -lh` do? What combinations of those flags are meaningful?

>>* "ls" lists the contents of  a directory.  
* "ls -a" includes entries in the directory beginning with "."  
* "ls -l" lists the contents of a directory with each file in long format (file mode, number of  
     links, owner name, group name, number of bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was  
     last modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the pathname)  
* "ls -lh" lists the contents of a directory in long format with the file size in Human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)    
* "ls -al" is a meaningful command since it will output all files in long format, including those that begin with "."

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

>>"xargs" executes a command from standard input.   
Example:  
```
$ echo Print two items on each line | xargs -n 2  
Print two  
items on  
each line  
```
